# Reflection

## What Copilot Generated
To build this project, I used GitHub Copilot to help create two of the main functions in my `data_cleaning.py` script. Before generating the code, I wrote short comments describing what each function should do, such as loading the data and cleaning the column names. After that, Copilot suggested full function blocks based on my comments. The functions that were mostly generated by Copilot were `load_data()` and `clean_column_names()`. Copilot also suggested parts of the logic for handling missing values and removing invalid rows.

## What I Modified
I did not accept Copilot’s suggestions exactly as written. I changed variable names to make them clearer, removed steps that did not apply to my dataset, and simplified some of the logic. For example, Copilot suggested filling missing values with averages, but I changed that to consistently fill them with zeros because that fit the assignment better. I also modified the column-cleaning function so that all column names became lowercase and used underscores, which Copilot did not originally include. These edits helped the code match my project structure and the assignment’s required cleaning rules.

## What I Learned
From this assignment, I learned how to apply basic data cleaning techniques in Python, such as fixing whitespace, handling missing data, and removing rows with invalid values. I also learned how helpful Copilot can be when starting a function, but that it still requires human judgment. Copilot gave me good starting points, but I had to adjust the code to fit the dataset and make sure it was correct. This showed me that AI tools can speed up coding, but they work best when I understand the logic and can make improvements myself.
